## Protection of Personal Data

At Magical20, we are committed to ensuring the security of our users' personal data. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. These measures include:

1. **Data Encryption**: We use industry-standard encryption protocols to protect personal data during transmission and storage.
2. **Access Control**: We limit access to personal data to employees, contractors, and agents who need this information to process it on our behalf and are subject to strict confidentiality obligations.
3. **Audits and Monitoring**: We conduct periodic internal and external audits to assess the effectiveness of our security measures and ensure compliance with applicable regulations.
4. **Employee Training**: We provide ongoing training to our staff on best practices for information security and personal data protection.
5. **Incident Management**: We have established procedures to manage any security incidents that may compromise personal data, including notifying the competent authorities and affected users when necessary.

Despite our efforts to protect your personal data, it is important to note that no security system is impenetrable. However, in the event of a security breach, we will take all necessary measures to mitigate its effects and prevent future incidents.

## Data Retention Periods and Criteria

At Magical20, we retain personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected. The criteria for determining retention periods include the duration of the contractual relationship, applicable legal obligations, and the legitimate interests of the company.

Once the data is no longer needed, we securely delete it using appropriate methods to ensure its confidentiality and prevent unauthorized access.

## User Rights

In compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union, users are guaranteed certain rights regarding their personal data. Below are these rights and how they can be exercised:

1. **Right of Access**: Users have the right to request confirmation of whether their personal data is being processed and, if so, to access it. This includes obtaining a copy of the personal data being processed.
2. **Right of Rectification**: Users may request the correction of inaccurate or incomplete personal data. It is important for personal data to be accurate and up to date.
3. **Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten)**: Users have the right to request the deletion of their personal data when it is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, among other circumstances.
4. **Right to Restriction of Processing**: Users may request the restriction of the processing of their personal data in certain situations, such as when the accuracy of the data is contested or the processing is unlawful.
5. **Right to Data Portability**: Users have the right to receive their personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and to transmit it to another data controller without hindrance, where technically feasible.
6. **Right to Object**: Users may object to the processing of their personal data at any time, on grounds relating to their particular situation, where the processing is based on legitimate interests or the performance of a public interest task.
7. **Right Not to Be Subject to Automated Decision-Making**: Users have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects them.

To exercise any of these rights, users may contact the data controller through the means indicated in the "Contact" section of this policy. They will be asked to provide sufficient information to verify their identity before their request is processed. Requests will be handled within a maximum period of one month unless the complexity or volume of requests requires an extension of up to two additional months, in which case the user will be notified of the extension.

## Data Transfer Outside the EEA

At Magical20, we are committed to ensuring that the transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) complies with the applicable data protection regulations, specifically the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Any transfer of personal data to countries outside the EEA will be conducted strictly in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR. This includes implementing appropriate safeguards to protect the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

To ensure an adequate level of protection for personal data, we use one or more of the following transfer mechanisms:

-   **Adequacy Decisions**: We transfer personal data to countries that the European Commission has recognized as providing an adequate level of data protection.
-   **Standard Contractual Clauses**: In the absence of an adequacy decision, we use standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission to ensure that personal data transferred outside the EEA is protected.
-   **Binding Corporate Rules**: In the case of transfers within a corporate group, we may use binding corporate rules that have been approved by the competent data protection authorities.

In situations where specific transfers of personal data outside the EEA are necessary, we ensure that they are carried out only when necessary for the performance of a contract between the user and Magical20 or when the user has given explicit consent for such a transfer.

For more information about the transfers of personal data outside the EEA and the safeguards implemented, users can contact us through the contact details provided in the "Contact" section of this Privacy Policy.

We are committed to reviewing and updating our data transfer practices to ensure ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
